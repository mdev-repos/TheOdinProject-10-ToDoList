# The Odin Project - To Do List Project (10)

This is the fourth project of twelve in total included in the JavaScript course, the sixth within the Fullstack JS developer path of The Odin Project.
This project required building a to-do application, a classic in any student's repository. 
The main idea was to use everything learned so far, adding the use of libraries through nmp (date-fns in this case) and the Web Storage API (localStorage) to somehow persist user data. 
One of the goals between projects was the creation of a template (github repository) to more quickly manage webpack configurations; this project was created in that way.

Still in progress | I hope you like my work :)

Tools: HTML / CSS / JS
Key concepts: OOP | Web Storage API | external libraries | webpack repo template
